# Deep Learning 2025 – Assignment 1

This repository contains the code and notebooks for our solution to **Deep Learning 2025 – Assignment 1**.

## Running the assignment code

Open the following notebooks in Jupyter (or JupyterLab) and run all cells from top to bottom.

- `feedforwardAssignment.ipynb`  
  - Feed-forward network experiments for **Task 3** (deep vs. wide networks).  
  - MLOps logging and hyperparameter sweep for **Task 4** (Weights & Biases).  
  - For Task 3.4, decision-boundary frames are saved to:
    - `frames_task3_4/`

- `DL_AutoDiff_Nanograd.ipynb`  
  - Nanograd-style automatic differentiation implementation for **Task 2**.  
  - Running all cells reproduces the autodiff results and gradient checks.

- `DL_Backpropagation_pen_and_paper.ipynb`  
  - Backpropagation derivations and numerical checks for **Task 1**.  
  - Running all cells reproduces the values reported in the PDF.
